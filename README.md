# Project4CardiovascularDisease_VisualData


Hi, I chose Cardiovascular Disease as my topic because I had a brother who died of heart failure when he was 2 months old. I have always thought a good doctor might have helped, but I can't keep thinking like that because it's been a long time, and we must look forward. Last but not least, I like to always include him in things that I do, and this was one of them. 


This is the website link for the dataset I used for this assignment: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/rates-and-trends-in-heart-disease-and-stroke-mortality-among-us-adults-35-by-county-a-2000-45659
